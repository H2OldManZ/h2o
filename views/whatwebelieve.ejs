											<h3><strong>God</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>There is but one God, infinite in power, wisdom, justice, goodness, and love, the Creator of the universe, eternally existing in three persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – each of whom possesses all the attributes of Deity and the characteristics of personality.</p>
										<p> [Exodus 3:14; Exodus 34:6-7; Isaiah 40, 42-45; Jeremiah 9:24; Matthew 19:26; Romans 11:33; Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 136:1; 1 John 4:8; Genesis 1:1; 1 Corinthians 8:4-6; 1 Timothy 1:17; Matthew 28:19; Luke 15; Acts 17:22-34; Colossians 2:9; John 11; Acts 5:3-9; Ephesians 4:30; 2 Corinthians 3:17-18]

											<h3><strong>Jesus Christ</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>God the Father, by His own choice and out of love for sinful men and women, sent Jesus Christ into the world to reconcile sinners to Himself. Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin. He is God in the flesh, both true God and true man. Jesus Christ lived a sinless life and voluntarily suffered and died as our substitute to pay the penalty for our sins, thus satisfying God’s justice and accomplishing salvation for all who trust in Him alone. He rose from the dead in the same body, though glorified, in which He lived and died. He bodily ascended into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God the Father, where He, the only mediator between God and man, makes intercession for His own. He will return to earth – personally, visibly, and bodily – to judge all humanity and establish His kingdom.</p>
										<p> [John 3:16; Luke 1:34-35, 2:7; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 2:17; Philippians 2:5-7; 1 Peter 3:18; Romans 3; Acts 16:29-31; 1 Corinthians 15:20-24, 35-49; Acts 1:9-11; Romans 8:34; 1 Timothy 2:5, Acts 1:11; 2 Timothy 4:1]</p>

											<h3><strong>The Spirit</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>The Holy Spirit has come into the world to reveal and glorify Christ, convict men and women of their sins, and to impart new life to all who place their faith in Christ. He indwells believers from the moment of spiritual birth, seals them until the day of redemption, and empowers them to live a life pleasing to God. </p>
										<p> [John 16:8-11, 13-15; Titus 3:4-7; Ephesians 1:13-14; Romans 8:2]</p>

											<h3><strong>The Resurrection of the Dead</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>At physical death, the believer enters immediately into eternal, conscious fellowship with the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting glory and blessing. At physical death the unbeliever enters immediately into eternal, conscious separation from the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting suffering, judgment and condemnation.</p>
										<p> [Philippians 1:23-24; 2 Corinthians 5:8; John 11:25-26; Luke 23:42-43; Philippians 3:20-21; 1 Corinthians 15; 2 Peter 2:9; Luke 16:19-31; John 8:21-24; 2 Thessalonians 1:6-9; Mark 9:47-48; John 5:28-29; Matthew 25:41, Revelation 20:11-15]</p>

											<h3><strong>The Church</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>All true believers make up the church worldwide and should assemble together in local churches – for worship, prayer, fellowship, and teaching – to become equipped to be fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ. </p>
										<p> [Acts 2:42-47; Ephesians 4:11-16; 1 Corinthians 12:12-13, 27-28; Hebrews 10:24-25; 1 Corinthians 1:2; Colossians 3:16, 4:2; Matthew 28:18-20]

											<h3><strong>The Bible</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>The sole basis of our beliefs is the Bible, the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments. It was uniquely, verbally, and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit and was written without error in the original manuscripts. It is the supreme and final authority in faith and life in every age. </p>
										<p>[Hebrews 1:1-2; John 10:35; Luke 24:44-45; John 14:26, 16:12-15; Revelation 22:18-19; 2 Peter 1:20-21; 2 Timothy 3:16; John 17:17; Psalm 19:7-11]</p>

											<h3><strong>Humanity</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>God created humanity in His own image, and humanity, as originally created, was innocent before God. But humanity chose to sin by disobeying God, and therefore was alienated from the Creator and came under divine condemnation. Thus all human beings are born with a corrupted nature and without spiritual life, and are totally incapable of pleasing God in themselves. </p>
										<p> [Genesis 1:27; Romans 5:12; Genesis 3, 5; Romans 1:18-2:2; Romans 5; Ephesians 2:1-3; Romans 3:23; Jeremiah 17:9; Romans 1-3, 8:6-8]</p>

											<h3><strong>Salvation</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>Men and women are freed from the penalty for their sins not as a result, in whole or in part, of their own works, goodness, or religious ceremony, but by the undeserved favor of God alone. God declares righteous all who put their faith in Christ alone for their salvation.</p>
										<p>[Ephesians 2:1-10; Titus 3:4-7; Galatians 2:11-4:20; Romans 1:18-3:31; 4:1-5, 5:1; Acts 4:12; 1 Timothy 2:5]</p>

											<h3><strong>Assurance</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>All who are born again of the Spirit can be fully assured of eternal life from the very moment in which they put their faith in Christ. This assurance is not based upon any kind of human merit, but upon the fact of God’s election, upon Christ’s complete payment for sins, and upon the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who is the deposit guaranteeing their inheritance. </p>
										<p>[John 3:3-16; 1 Peter 1:3-9; Ephesians 1:4-5; John 10:26-30; Romans 8:32-34; Ephesians 1:13-14]</p>

											<h3><strong>Baptism and the Lord's Supper</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>The Lord Jesus Christ has instructed those who believe in Him to be baptized in water as a symbol of their new birth in Christ. Baptism is only for those who have personally believed in Christ. Our practice is to baptize by immersion. The Lord also instituted the Lord’s Supper as a remembrance of His suffering, death, and resurrection. Neither baptism nor the Lord’s Supper have any merit in helping a person obtain eternal life. </p>
										<p> [Matthew 28:18-19; Romans 6:3-4; Titus 3:4-6; Acts 8:36-38; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 6:27-29]</p>
